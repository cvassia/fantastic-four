        <strong>The Fantastic Four</strong> is a fictional superhero team
        appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The group
        debuted in The Fantastic Four, which helped to usher in a new level of
        realism in the medium. The Fantastic Four was the first superhero team
        created by editor/co-plotter Stan Lee and artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby,
        who developed a collaborative approach to creating comics with this
        title that they would use from then on.

        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
          The Fantastic Four is a fictional superhero team appearing in American
          comic books published by Marvel Comics. The group debuted in The
          Fantastic Four #1 (cover dated Nov. 1961), which helped to usher in a
          new level of realism in the medium. The Fantastic Four was the first
          superhero team created by editor/co-plotter Stan Lee and
          artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby, who developed a collaborative approach
          to creating comics with this title that they would use from then on.
          The four individuals traditionally associated with the Fantastic Four,
          who gained superpowers after exposure to cosmic rays during a
          scientific mission to outer space, are Mister Fantastic (Reed
          Richards), a scientific genius and the leader of the group.

        <h2>Origins</h2>

        <p>
          Apocryphal legend has it that in 1961, longtime magazine and comic
          book publisher Martin Goodman was playing golf with either Jack
          Liebowitz or Irwin Donenfeld of rival company DC Comics, then known as
          National Periodical Publications, and that the top executive bragged
          about DC's success with the new superhero team the Justice League of
          America.[note 1] While film producer and comics historian Michael
          Uslan has debunked the particulars of that story,[note 2] Goodman, a
          publishing trend-follower, aware of the JLA's strong sales, did direct
          his comics editor, Stan Lee, to create a comic-book series about a
          team of superheroes. According to Lee, writing in 1974.

        <h2>Characters</h2>

        <p>
          Mister Fantastic (Reed Richards), a scientific genius, can stretch,
          twist and re-shape his body to inhuman proportions. Mr. Fantastic
          serves as the father figure of the group, and is "appropriately
          pragmatic, authoritative, and dull".[45]:19 Richards blames himself
          for the failed space mission, particularly because of how the event
          transformed pilot Ben Grimm.[45]:205 Stan Lee said the stretch powers
          were inspired by DC's Plastic Man, which had no equivalent in
          Marvel.[97] Invisible Girl/Invisible Woman (Susan Storm), Reed
          Richards' girlfriend (and eventual wife) has the ability to bend and
          manipulate light to render herself and others invisible. Stan Lee did
          not want Sue to have superstrength, "to be Wonder Woman and punch
          people", so eventually he came to invisibility, inspired by works such
          as The Invisible Man.
